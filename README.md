## React Native Pokedex

### Description
A simple Pokedex app built with React Native and Expo. The app uses the PokeAPI to fetch data about pokemon and display it in a list. The user can then click on a pokemon to view more details about it.

Animations are made using Reanimated 3, so you will need a version of Expo Go that supports SDK 49

### Installation Instructions
1. Make sure you have Expo Go installed on your device (SDK 49)
2. Clone this repo and run npm install / yarn install
3. Make sure your device and laptop are connected to the same wifi network
4. Run `npx expo start` from project root
5. Open the expo go app on your device and the running project should be listed on the main screen
6. If not, Scan the QR code and the app should start building on your device
